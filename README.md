## Overview

**Online Documentation:**
The latest documentation is automatically built and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://stlab.github.io/copy-on-write/) on every push to the main branch.

**Version Management:**
The project version is maintained in a single location in the `project()` command at the top of `CMakeLists.txt`. When creating a new release:
1. Update the version in `project(stlab-copy-on-write VERSION X.Y.Z)`
2. The version will automatically propagate to:
   - CMake package configuration
   - Doxygen documentation
   - GitHub release

`stlab::copy_on_write<T>` is a smart pointer that implements copy-on-write semantics. It allows multiple instances to share the same underlying data until one of them needs to modify it, at which point a copy is made. This can provide significant performance benefits when dealing with expensive-to-copy objects that are frequently copied but rarely modified.

## Features

- **Thread-safe**: Uses atomic reference counting for safe concurrent access
- **Header-only**: No compilation required, just include the header
- **C++17**: Leverages modern C++ features for clean, efficient implementation

## Examples

The project includes executable examples that demonstrate the library's functionality:

- **`example/basic_usage.cpp`**: Comprehensive demonstration of copy-on-write semantics, identity checking, and swap operations

Examples are automatically built and run as part of the test suite to ensure they remain up-to-date and functional. They are also included in the generated documentation.

## Building and Testing

This library uses CMake with CPM for dependency management:

```bash
# Configure and build
cmake --preset=test
cmake --build --preset=test

# Run tests
ctest --preset=test
```

### Including in Your Project

To include this library in your project using CPM:

```cmake
CPMAddPackage(
    NAME stlab-copy-on-write
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY stlab/copy-on-write
    GIT_TAG main # or specify a version tag
)

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE stlab::copy-on-write)
```

The library's headers will be available under the `stlab/` directory:

```cpp
#include <stlab/copy_on_write.hpp>
```

### Building Documentation

Documentation is generated using Doxygen with the modern [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme:

```bash
# Configure and build documentation
cmake --preset=docs
cmake --build --preset=docs

# View documentation (opens in browser)
open build/docs/html/index.html
```

**Requirements for documentation:**

- Doxygen 1.9.1 or later

To update the `Doxyfile.in` with a newer version of Doxygen use the following command:

```bash
doxygen -u docs/Doxyfile.in
```

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, automatically:

- **Testing**: Builds and tests on Ubuntu (GCC/Clang), macOS (Clang), and Windows (MSVC)
- **Documentation**: Builds and deploys documentation to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes

All pull requests must pass CI checks before merging.

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.20 or later (for building tests)
